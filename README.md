# Emotional
Facial Emotion Recognition from webcam feed using OpenCV and CNNs.

A pretrained CNN model h5 file is stored in `models` directory. The CNN model used in this project was trained on FER2013 Dataset from Kaggle.
OpenCV HaarCascades was used to detect faces and then send it to CNN model to classify the expression.
Run the `Emotional` jupyter notebook to see it in action.

> Note: To train your very own CNN model for this project checkout my [Kaggle-Emotion](https://github.com/mohityogesh44/Kaggle-Emotion) repository.
